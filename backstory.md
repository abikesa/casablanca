- The writers mythologized the backstory by throwing us a bone
- But can we get to its core? To the marrow?
- The Matrix was such a tidy script according to Tarantino; Part 2 & 3 Destroyed the mythology
- And so our imaginative couple here who wish to create a comic-strip out of the ambiguous backstory?
- Well, doesn't matter. Just tells us the writers were intelligent and considered their audience intelligent too

# Rick Blaine's history in Casablanca

[Hubby and I](https://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/1yrak5/rick_blaines_history_in_casablanca/) were watching Casablanca. In this movie, Rick cannot return to America, but it is never said why. We brainstormed for reasons and tried to piece together a possible history for Rick.

Notes:

The Germans have an extensive dossier on Rick, down to his eye color, but were unable to turn up WHY he can't return to America. Because of this, we ruled out an active warrant for his arrest or a military desertion, both of which would be relatively publicized info.
Rick leans chaotic-good, as evidenced by his history running guns to Ethiopia during its war with Italy in 1936, fighting on the loyalist side in the Spanish Civil War in 1935, cheating at roulette to help a destitute couple get out of Casablanca, and giving up love for the cause of the greater good. He's jaded now, but obviously willing to risk his skin to work on the side of right.
Rick has an African-American friend and employee, Sam, who has stayed with him through at least his time in France. Sam is obviously intensely loyal to Rick, following him to Casablanca and turning down a salary double what Rick pays him.
Given the age of the actor, Rick is likely about 45 during the events of Casablanca in 1941. From his accent and stated familiarity with bad parts of the city ("there are parts of New York I would advise you not invade"), he is most likely from New York.
It might not be explicitly stated, but it seems reasonable to consider that Rick may have had military service in his history from his comfort with guns and volatile situations.
The fan theory we devised.

Rick fought in World War I. He would have been in his late teens at the start of WWI. If he was from Harlem (the "part of New York I would not advise you to invade"), he might have been familiar with the [Harlem Hellfighters](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/369th_Infantry_Regiment_(United_States)). This unit went to the battlefields of WWI in 1918, when Rick was ~22 years old.
Rick wouldn't have been a soldier in the Harlem Hellfighters, since it was a segregated African-American/Puerto Rican unit. But the unit had white officers. Do you see where I'm going with this?
Leading a segregated unit would give a young Rick the military expertise that would come in handy in his later adventures, the dogged sense of fairness he carried throughout the rest of his life, and at least one black friend with the intense camaraderie you'd get by serving with him. Sam could have been a soldier or another officer.
Oh, and did I mention that, though the US was officially neutral, many African-American military infantry unit members acted as mercenaries to support Ethiopia by running guns, and also supported loyalist Spain against the fascists? A partnership through this type of engagement would further cement a relationship between Rick and Sam.
The 369th spent time in France in WWI, which might have led Rick to decide on it as his second home when he left the US (if he built friendships there, was familiar with Paris, or simply spoke French well).
So why can't he return to the US? That's a tough one.

In 1919, after WWI, African American soldiers got annoyed with the fact that they were risking their lives for a country that treated them like garbage, resulting in the [Red Summer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Summer_(1919)). The Germans didn't turn up a warrant for Rick's arrest. But what about Sam? Sam could have been part of one of the many tussles-gone-wrong over the Red Summer, resulting in the death of a police officer or influential white person. If Rick helped Sam escape capture out of a sense of friendship and justice, it would easily lead to the kind of intense gratitude Sam displays, and it provided a reason for Rick and Sam to leave the US. It's not that Rick can't return to the US. It's that Sam can't return - and Rick won't abandon Sam. Telling anyone about the true reason Rick won't return to the US might put Sam at risk - either by extraditing Sam to the US, or from enemies knowing Rick's weak spot is his best friend.

On a related note, I would pay good money for a comic book about Sam and Rick having rollicking adventures throughout Europe in the 1920s.

tl;dr Rick led an African-American unit in WWI, became friends with Sam, and can't return to the US because Sam got in trouble during the Red Summer of 1919.
