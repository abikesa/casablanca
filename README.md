1. Root
2. Pentatonic
   - Straighforward plot from [golden age](https://www.sparknotes.com/film/casablanca/section1/)
3. Diatonic
4. Chromatic
5. Temperament
6. Expression
    - Withdrawn/Mismatch
       - `Unresolved` conflict 
    - Engaged/Victory
       - Personal growth, allegories of world affairs, weltanshauungs
       - If the film concluded with the simple message that `victory` requires sacrifice, then the ending would be a happy one.
    - Imposition/Ragnarok
       - Nazi
       - It's really with the Russian allies that prospects of Ragnarok became eminent
