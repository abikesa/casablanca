Delving deeper into the Freudian undertones of "[Casablanca](http://www.vincasa.com/casabla.pdf)," we can explore the [complex emotional landscape of its characters](https://github.com/abikesa/music/blob/main/zion.md), particularly through the dynamic interplay between Rick, Ilsa, and Victor. The film intricately weaves a narrative that not only entertains but also provides a profound commentary on the human psyche, as interpreted through a Freudian lens.

### **Song: Freudian Ensemble and Oedipal Complex**

In "Casablanca," the Freudian dynamics are palpable, with Rick embodying the ego, navigating between his desires and moral duties, Ilsa as the superego, representing ideals and moral standards, and Victor as the id, the primal source of desire and impulse. However, this characterization can be nuanced further by considering the Oedipal complex, which adds a layer of depth to the emotional entanglements and rivalries present in the film.

### **Rick: The Ego in Conflict**

Rick, as the ego, finds himself torn between his love for Ilsa (the superego) and his underlying, repressed desires (the id), which Victor inadvertently represents. Rick's caf√©, a neutral ground, symbolizes his attempt to maintain balance and control over his internal conflicts. However, the arrival of Ilsa and Victor disrupts this equilibrium, forcing Rick to confront his suppressed feelings and desires.

### **Ilsa: The Superego and Object of Desire**

Ilsa, as the superego, embodies the ethical and moral ideals that guide Rick's actions. However, she also represents the object of desire within the Oedipal framework, the maternal figure that both Rick (the child/ego) and Victor (the rival/id) vie for. Her presence ignites Rick's suppressed emotions, challenging his detached demeanor and neutrality.

### **Victor: The Id and Oedipal Rival**

Victor, often seen as the id or the primal force of desire and impulse, also plays a critical role in the Oedipal triangle. His relationship with Ilsa introduces an element of rivalry with Rick, invoking the Oedipal conflict wherein the son competes with the father figure for the affection of the mother figure. Victor's commitment to a cause greater than himself contrasts with Rick's initially self-centered perspective, highlighting the tension between personal desires and greater goods.

### **"As Time Goes By": A Freudian Trigger**

The song "As Time Goes By" acts as a Freudian trigger, awakening Rick's repressed memories and emotions tied to Ilsa. This moment of emotional vulnerability reveals the depth of Rick's internal conflict, where the ego (Rick) must navigate the competing demands of the superego (Ilsa's moral and ethical ideals) and the id (his primal desires and the rivalry with Victor).

### **Resolution: Transcending the Oedipal Complex**

The resolution of "Casablanca" transcends the Oedipal complex, as Rick makes a sacrificial choice that aligns with the superego's demands, prioritizing the greater good over personal desires. This act of selflessness marks Rick's growth and the integration of his ego, superego, and id, resolving the Freudian conflict in a manner that affirms his moral integrity.

By exploring "Casablanca" through a Freudian and Oedipal lens, we uncover the rich emotional and psychological depths of its characters. The film masterfully navigates the complex interplay of desires, duties, and moral dilemmas, illustrating the enduring relevance of Freudian concepts in understanding the nuances of human relationships and the art that seeks to depict them.
