2. Pentatonic
   - Straighforward plot from [golden age](https://www.sparknotes.com/film/casablanca/section1/)

4. Chromatic
   - For Rick and Ilsa, however, the conclusion is neither as happy nor as simple. Not only do the lovers have to split up a second time, but neither truly knows what the other is thinking. Laszlo undoubtedly loves Ilsa, but Rick's and Ilsa's feelings aren't so clear. The film demonstrates the moral value of sacrifice and the triumph of the political over personal desire, but the final scene is full of `ambiguity`
5. Temperament
6. Expression
    - Withdrawn/Mismatch
       - `Unresolved` conflict 
    - Engaged/Victory
       - Personal growth, allegories of world affairs, weltanshauungs
       - If the film concluded with the simple message that `victory` requires sacrifice, then the ending would be a happy one.
    - Imposition/Ragnarok
       - Nazi
       - It's really with the Russian allies that prospects of Ragnarok became eminent
