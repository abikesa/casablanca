- Rick is easy to understand:
     1. Mismatch/Hideth/Children
     2. Victory/Whineth/[Boyz-II-Men](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wM7hsJw6dWo)
     3. Ragnarok/Tameth/Adults
         - Here's where we find him at Rick's Cafe
         - Sort of a regression to "hideth" in this corner of all bars, in all cities, of all countries of the world
         - But also a progression from the "whineth" of Paris caused by the Ragnarok the Nazi's set off (think Nagasaki & Hiroshima and subsequent cold war)
         - In a sense Rick "tameth" his patrons but also "resigneth" to fate in context of war and Ragnarok; gives support to idealists (who are merely at stage 2)

*The scene is just one of a number of brilliant moments in Michael Curtiz's 1942 film (including another scene based around the song!), but it's arguably the scene that best establishes the movie's ensemble of characters, their histories and interpersonal relationships, and the wistful, bittersweetly nostalgic, tragic romantic tone of the entire movie. The song "As Time Goes By" perfectly encapsulates these emotions, so much so that it would be nearly impossible to believe that it was almost cut from the film. - [Bill Bria](https://www.slashfilm.com/806368/one-of-casablancas-most-memorable-moments-was-almost-cut-from-the-film/)*

Delving deeper into the Freudian undertones of "[Casablanca](http://www.vincasa.com/casabla.pdf)," we can explore the [complex emotional landscape of its characters](https://github.com/abikesa/music/blob/main/zion.md), particularly through the dynamic interplay between Rick, Ilsa, and Victor. The film intricately weaves a narrative that not only entertains but also provides a profound commentary on the human psyche, as interpreted through a Freudian lens.

### **Song: Freudian Ensemble and Oedipal Complex**

In "Casablanca," the Freudian dynamics are palpable, with Rick embodying the ego, navigating between his desires and moral duties, Ilsa as the superego, representing ideals and moral standards, and Victor as the id, the primal source of desire and impulse. However, this characterization can be nuanced further by considering the Oedipal complex, which adds a layer of depth to the emotional entanglements and rivalries present in the film.

### **Rick: The Ego in Conflict**

Rick, as the ego, finds himself torn between his love for Ilsa (the superego) and his underlying, repressed desires (the id), which Victor inadvertently represents. Rick's caf√©, a neutral ground, symbolizes his attempt to maintain balance and control over his internal conflicts. However, the arrival of Ilsa and Victor disrupts this equilibrium, forcing Rick to confront his suppressed feelings and desires.

### **Ilsa: The Superego and Object of Desire**

Ilsa, as the superego, embodies the ethical and moral ideals that guide Rick's actions. However, she also represents the object of desire within the Oedipal framework, the maternal figure that both Rick (the child/ego) and Victor (the rival/id) vie for. Her presence ignites Rick's suppressed emotions, challenging his detached demeanor and neutrality.

### **Victor: The Id and Oedipal Rival**

Victor, often seen as the id or the primal force of desire and impulse, also plays a critical role in the Oedipal triangle. His relationship with Ilsa introduces an element of rivalry with Rick, invoking the Oedipal conflict wherein the son competes with the father figure for the affection of the mother figure. Victor's commitment to a cause greater than himself contrasts with Rick's initially self-centered perspective, highlighting the tension between personal desires and greater goods.

### **"As Time Goes By": A Freudian Trigger**

The song "As Time Goes By" acts as a Freudian trigger, awakening Rick's repressed memories and emotions tied to Ilsa. This moment of emotional vulnerability reveals the depth of Rick's internal conflict, where the ego (Rick) must navigate the competing demands of the superego (Ilsa's moral and ethical ideals) and the id (his primal desires and the rivalry with Victor).

### **Resolution: Transcending the Oedipal Complex**

The resolution of "Casablanca" transcends the Oedipal complex, as Rick makes a sacrificial choice that aligns with the superego's demands, prioritizing the greater good over personal desires. This act of selflessness marks Rick's growth and the integration of his ego, superego, and id, resolving the Freudian conflict in a manner that affirms his moral integrity.

By exploring "Casablanca" through a Freudian and Oedipal lens, we uncover the rich emotional and psychological depths of its characters. The film masterfully navigates the complex interplay of desires, duties, and moral dilemmas, illustrating the enduring relevance of Freudian concepts in understanding the nuances of human relationships and the art that seeks to depict them.
