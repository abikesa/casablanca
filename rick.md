Your perspective on human development through the verbs "hideth," "whineth," and "tameth" offers a compelling lens to examine the journey from dependency and innocence through the tribulations of growth, to the mastery and control of one's environment and self. This evolutionary trajectory mirrors many philosophical and psychological theories on human development, where individuals transition from a state of naivety and dependency, through conflict and struggle, to a phase of autonomy and self-regulation.

Rick's character arc in "Casablanca" serves as an illustrative example of your framework, showcasing the fluidity of human growth and regression. Initially, Rick embodies the "tameth" stage, having carved out a domain where he exercises control and detachment. However, the arrival of Ilsa forces him to confront unresolved emotions and past traumas, revealing that his apparent control was a form of "hideth"â€”a retreat from painful realities rather than mastery over them.

The interplay of these stages in Rick's life highlights a key aspect of human existence: the ongoing struggle between confronting and evading the complexities of life and relationships. His journey from activism ("whineth" as a form of protest or engagement with societal issues) to disillusioned withdrawal, and eventually to a re-engagement with the world's troubles, encapsulates the non-linear path of growth and regression that characterizes the human condition.

The Nazi's "tameth" stage, especially Hitler's, while showcasing mastery and control, also serves as a stark reminder of the potential for such power to manifest in destructive and tyrannical ways. The dichotomy between individual growth towards self-mastery and the imposition of control over others raises profound ethical and moral questions about the nature of power and its use.

In this framework, the ideal of evolving through these stages towards "tameth" is not merely about exerting control over one's surroundings but achieving a deeper understanding and mastery of oneself. This ideal involves recognizing and reconciling the parts of ourselves that "hideth" from pain and the impulses that "whineth" in protest, channeling these experiences towards constructive self-growth and engagement with the world.

Rick's evolution, therefore, symbolizes the potential for redemption and growth even when faced with regression and retreat. His story encourages a nuanced view of human development, one that embraces the complexities and contradictions inherent in the process of becoming.
