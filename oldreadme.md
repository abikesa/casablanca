Your perspective touches on a fascinating and deeply philosophical view of beauty and engagement. It aligns with the idea that mystery and the unknown hold a particular allure that fully comprehensible entities lack. This concept isn't new; it echoes thoughts from various philosophical and artistic traditions that suggest true beauty lies in complexity, subtlety, and the layers that [unravel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkkMs-UZpbU) over time.

In a way, what you're describing is the beauty of the ineffable—things that cannot be fully expressed or understood immediately, if at all. This notion can be seen in the works of Romantic poets like Keats, who famously wrote of "negative capability," or the ability to accept uncertainty and mystery without the irritable reaching after fact and reason. Similarly, in the visual arts, abstract expressionists valued the emotional impact and interpretations their works could inspire over any definitive meaning.

Your stance also brings to mind the aesthetic and intellectual pleasure derived from the process of discovery and the journey toward understanding. It suggests that beauty, in its most engaging form, invites us to `explore`, question, and reflect rather than to simply `observe` and `comprehend`. This engagement is not just aesthetic but deeply cognitive, intertwining with our natural curiosity and desire for intellectual challenge.

However, while the allure of the incomprehensible is undeniable, it's worth considering that there's also beauty in clarity and simplicity. Sometimes, the elegance of a concept or an object lies in its straightforwardness, its ability to be immediately grasped. This doesn't necessarily detract from its depth but rather presents a different kind of beauty—one that resides in purity, order, and transparency. Think of the architectural principles of Le Corbusier or the Zen gardens of Japan, where the beauty is palpable yet fully comprehensible in its serene simplicity.

In essence, beauty is multifaceted and subjective. The [seduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seduction) of the incomprehensible you describe speaks to a deep and enriching form of engagement with the world—a pursuit of endless discovery and the joy of constantly expanding our horizons. However, the simplicity and clarity of understanding offer their own unique pleasures and insights, suggesting that perhaps the most profound beauty lies in balancing these contrasting experiences.

- Casablanca is the "unfolding" of Rick's character
- He's mysterious in the early phases
- Then a curious study for us
- And then outrightly seductive when a "backstory" emerges in the form of "As Time Goes By"
- Just like our Ab Arpeggio by LaFayetter Jr. is an unfolding of the harmonic series
   - First the "lower" harmonics 1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th
   - Then mid-range 11th and 13th
   - But ultimately "jazzy" 17th & 19th
      - A reharm with C7 as the final chord turns the melodic riff into a #9-b9 (i.e., b9 is 17th on C, and #9 is 19th)
- Rick's selflessness is irrefutible in the final conversation before the credits:
   - I think we are going to make good friends...
